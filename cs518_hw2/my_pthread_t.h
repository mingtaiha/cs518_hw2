	READY: 		A thread has been created and is ready to be scheduled.
	RUNNING:	A thread is currently running
	WAITING:	A thread is currently waiting to be scheduled. This thread
					was originally running but has either yielded to another

					execution
	QUEUED:		A thread is currently enqueued for scheduled
	TERMINATED:	A thread has completed execution or has been killed

		be inserted into the queue for scheduling. Additional information information
		include the Thread ID, Number of Runs, and Priority. There is also
		a struct which contains the thread attributes, as well as void pointer
		which contains the values returned from execution.

//	Defining a basic Scheduler class
/*
	This class contains as a pointer to a multi-level priority scheduler, a pointer
		for multiple wait queues, and a pointer to a const list of run timings. The
		scheduler also has a pthread which contains the main context, as well as a
		counter for the number of threads assigned. The scheduler also keeps track
		of the current thread that is being run.

	MING:: The reason why the scheduler should contain the main context is so the
		scheduler can be instantiated first before creating the first mypthread_t.
		Making the first mypthread requires a uclink, which would be the main context.
		Moreover, the scheduler should exist such that any thread can be scheduled
		at anytime. If the scheduler has a pthread which contains the main context,
		the scheduling new threads can always access the main thread if needed.
